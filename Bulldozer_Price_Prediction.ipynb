    "# Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers by Shoaib Hoque\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are going to predict the sale price of bulldozers using time series. for which, we need to follow the steps below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "How well we can predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and prevoius examples of how much similar bulldozers sold before.\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "The data is dowloaded from the Kaggle Blubook for Bulldozers competition :\n",
    "The data is split into three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Train.csv is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.\n",
    "- Valid.csv is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.\n",
    "- Test.csv is the test set, which won't be released until the last week of the competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test set determines your final rank for the competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key fields are in train.csv are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SalesID: the uniue identifier of the sale\n",
    "- MachineID: the unique identifier of a machine.  A machine can be sold multiple times\n",
    "- saleprice: what the machine sold for at auction (only provided in train.csv)\n",
    "- saledate: the date of the sale\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal for this project will be to build a machine learning model which minimizes RMSLE.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Features\n",
    "kaggle provides a data dictionary detailing all of the features of the dataset. "
